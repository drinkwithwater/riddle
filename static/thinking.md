0. This is a combined optimization problem for players.

1. Comparing with normal SRPG: (sign !!! means very important)
	a) simple&clever ui with logic (reference to heartstone) !!!
		Make caculating easier.
		Easy operation for touch screen mobile phone.
	b) pve mode (reference to diablo3) !!!
		This make it become a combined optimization problem.
		One goal is to maximize outputing damager and minimize incoming damager.
	c) explicit enemy AI !!!
		Thinking to search in decision tree become easy for player.
	d) no complicate unit design

2. Future design
	a) import some other good concepts
		e.g.
		damage burst stragegy
		hit&run strategy
		map cover with shadow -- information
		operation to owner's unit !!!
	b) range damage
	c) direction towards (TODO)
	d) random value ???

3. Script design
	a) make rider leaving his place
	b) maximize hp utilize
	c) push box, pokemon ruby...
	d) wrap unit with wall, like prison

4. Moving concept
	a) push box
	b) rider
	c) trigger attacking between 2 unit in a line
	d) transfer
	e) Pao in Chinese chess

5. subset
	a) push box
	b) chess
